# Project for HackYeah 2023

## About us
We are six friends from [Upper-secondary Schools of Communications](https://tl.krakow.pl/). In this project, we were split into three groups - backend, frontend and Database. 

## About project 
Our project named Uniscover lets you select options and filter your future field of studies in an easy, foolproof way. Adding an AI chat allows users to customize their selections and get an almost personal experience. The database, backend and React website are easy to edit and extend for improvements and additions.

## The Goal
We've tried our best to deliver the best possible software in the time of 24 hours during HackYeah 2023!
